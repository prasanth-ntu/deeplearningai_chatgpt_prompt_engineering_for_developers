So, **this course will focus on best practices for instruction tuned LLMs which is what we recommend you use for most of your applications**. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you use an instruction tuned LLMs, think of giving instructions to another person that's smart but doesn't know the specifics of your task. So, when an LLMs doesn't work, sometimes it's because the instructions weren't clear enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \n",
    "- if you wereto say, \"*please write me something about Alan Turing Well*\" \n",
    "- in addition to that, it can be helpful to be clear about \n",
    "    - whether you want the text to focus on his scientific work or \n",
    "    - his personal life or \n",
    "    - his role in history or \n",
    "    - something else\n",
    "- and, if you specify what you want the tone of the text to be \n",
    "    - should it take on the tone like a professional journalist would write? Or \n",
    "    - is it more of a casual note that you dash off to a friend that hopes the LLMs generate what you want? \n",
    "- and, of course, if you picture yourself asking a fresh college graduate to carry out this task for you, and if you can even specify what snippets of text they should read in advance to write this text about Alan Turing.
