    "    - his personal life or \n",
    "    - his role in history or \n",
    "    - something else\n",
    "- and, if you specify what you want the tone of the text to be \n",

And you know, this would happen for a person too. If  you ask someone to complete a complex math question without time to work out the answer first, they would also likely make a mistake.
